## What is Pixel Vision 8

PV8's core philosophy is to teach retro game development with streamlined workflows. It enables designing games around limited resolutions, colors, sprites, sound and memory. It is ideal for game jams, prototyping ideas or having fun.

Pixel Vision 8 is also a platform that standardizes 8-bit fantasy console limitations. Developers can customize these restrictions to match actual legacy hardware or create something new. The challenge of working within these confines forces creativity and limits scope. Pixel Vision 8 creations are expressions of ingenuity that rise above their limitations.

## Plugin Features

This plugin was designed to add autocomplete and other features for using the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) with [Pixel Vision 8](https://pixelvision8.com).

* Auto complete for Pixel Vision 8's Lua APIs.
* Auto complete for the Pixel Vision OS's UI framework (coming soon)
* Code templates (coming soon)

## Getting Started
Before you open your PV8 game’s Lua files in Atom, you will want to add a few packages. The first one is Pixel Vision 8’s API autocomplete package. You do this by going to Atom’s settings, then select the install tab. From there type in `pixel-vision-8` and search for the plugin.

Once installed, you will be able to get PV8 API code completion in any `.lua` file you work on in the editor.

Just start typing out the first 3 letters of a PV8 API and the autocomplete drop-down will give you the options to choose from. Each listing has a detailed description of what the API does, as well as an autocomplete template allowing you to tab through each of the arguments once you have hit returned and added the code snippet to your project.

Another advantage of installing the PV8 Atom plugin is that you can keep it up to date with each release. This allows you to have the latest API autocomplete definitions without having to dig through the documentation to see the latest changes.

You will also want to install a good Lua plugin if you have not done so already. I use `language-lua` by FireZenk.

There are lots of other great Atom plugins that can help you work with Pixel Vision 8’s other data files.
